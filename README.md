# Escape Horror House

(table of contents)


## Introduction

This a small interactive adventure game that challenges the player to try and escape from a horror house after being held captive by a mysterious person. There is only one way out and many ways to be caught, trying to escape. We use a command line interface to let the user interact with the game. The user will make their decisions based on the scenario they find them selves in and their decisions will ultimately win the game or lose the game.

## UX

By visiting this site, as a user I would like: 

- to play a game to improve my congnitive function.
- to immediately understand what the game is and how it works.
- to enjoy and understand the theme of the game.
- to play a brain training game whilst having a fun experience.

## Development Cycle

At the beginnig of the project I want to make sure I had a good understanding of what the storyline and how was our was going to structure the paths/options for the user.

I used the following development steps:

* Create a basic story line
* Create a decision tree
* Finalise the story at each decision
* Code the logic using with functions and if/elif
* Add time delay effect for text


## Testing

This section provides details of testing performed during development. 

Testing was done as each change was saved.

* Within Gitpod I used the termial to pass through the text/game to understand the changes I made.
* As well as this, it allowed me to spot and fix potential errors in the game instead of finding these out at the end.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found here

### Creating an Application with Heroku

I used the video tutorial provided by The Code Institute to create a Heroku account, add the details of the app and deploy the application to a live environment.

* Log into Heroku
* Click New
* Give the app a name and choose the region
* Click on settings first and set the Reveal Config Vars
* PORT = Key 8000 = Value
* If using CREDS please make sure this has been added to the requirements file.
* Add build pack include Python and Node.js
* The order of the buildpacks is important, in the list Python should be first with Node.js second. If they are not in this order, you can click and drag them to rearrange.
* Click Deploy at the top to go to the Deployment settings
* Choose GiHub as the deployment method
* Search for your app and connect
* Use Automatic deploys if you would like a new build when changes are pushed to GitHub from Gitpod
* Use Manual deploy for a new build every time this button is clicked.
* Once completed click View App



## Future Improvements

Add more difficult levels/paths to the the game to challenge users more and create a more detailed storyline.  The user would be able to build upon each level of the game.
